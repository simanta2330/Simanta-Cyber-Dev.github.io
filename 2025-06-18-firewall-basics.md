A **firewall** is your systemâ€™s first line of defense. In this blog, I explain the different types of firewalls, how they work, and how to set them up in Linux using UFW.

## ðŸ§± Types of Firewalls

- Packet Filtering
- Stateful Inspection
- Application Layer (Proxy)
- Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW)

## ðŸ’» UFW Example (Linux)

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw status
```

> Firewalls are essential for both SOC Analysts and Penetration Testers. Practice using them on virtual machines or TryHackMe labs.
